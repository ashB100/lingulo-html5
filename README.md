lingulo-html5
=============

A responsive HTML5 website from tutorial (http://www.lingulo.com/) 

Used the following:  

1. Viewport meta tag which defines how the website should be displayed on a device. 
Setting width to device-width sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device
and initial-scale to 1.0  and sets the inital zoom level to 1.0.  There is debate on whether to use width=device-width only, as this width doesn't workout for landscape orientation which should use height instead. 
or initial-scale=1.0 only as it might have zoom problems in iOS.

2. Eric Meyer's Reset CSS.

3. Lightbox2 to overlay images on top of current page when a smaller image is clicked.

4. Google Web Fonts to use Open Sans and Baumans

5. Modernizr.js to detect the browsers support of HTML5 and CSS3 features

6. html5shiv to enable HTML5 elements in Internet Explorer. 

7. Respond.js to allow Media Queries support in IE and other browsers that might not support Media Queries.

8. Prefix Free which automatically creates the required prefixes and lets us write unprefixed CSS3 properties. 

9. Responsive slideshow plug-in SlideJs for slideshow.
